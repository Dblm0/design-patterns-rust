# Design Patterns in Rust

This repository is developed to be a part of the [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) project.

It contains **Rust** ðŸ¦€ examples for all classic GoF design patterns.

## Requirements

These examples have been tested with a _stable_ `rustc 1.62` (2021 edition).

All examples can be launched via the command line, using `cargo` as follows:

```
cargo run --bin adapter
```

For the best experience, I recommend working with examples with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
