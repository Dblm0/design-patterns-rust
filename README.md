# Design Patterns in Rust

This repository contains **Rust** ðŸ¦€ examples for **all 23 classic GoF design
patterns**, and even a little more. It is developed to be a part of the [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) project.

Each example is designed to introduce _a practical applicability_ in **Rust**, either
it's a conceptual or a real world example. The Rust ideology and
all the specifics are taken into account.

1. For instance, some patterns are easy to implement with Rust, mostly
   creational ones, e.g.
   [Prototype](creational/prototype),
   [Static Creation Method](creational/static-creation-method/).
2. The [Mediator](behavioral/mediator) behavioral pattern is hardest to
   implement with Rust, considering Rust's specific ownership model with a
   strict borrow checker rules.

You can find README.md in each example with instructions and additional explanation.

## Requirements

These examples have been tested with a _stable_ `rustc 1.62` (2021 edition).

All examples can be launched via the command line, using `cargo` as follows:
