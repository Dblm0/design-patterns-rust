# Design Patterns in Rust

This repository contains **Rust** ðŸ¦€ examples for **all 23 classic GoF design
patterns**, and even a little more.

It is developed to be a part of the [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) project.

Examples have been designed to introduce _a practical applicability_ in **Rust**.
There are conceptual and read-world examples. In both cases, Rust idiomatic ways of code
development and all the specifics are taken into account.

Some patterns are really easy to implement with Rust, mostly
creational ones, e.g.
[Prototype](creational/prototype),
[Static Creation Method](creational/static-creation-method/).

On the other hand, the [Mediator](behavioral/mediator) behavioral pattern
is the hardest to implement with Rust, considering Rust's specific ownership
model with a strict borrow checker rules.

You can find README.md in each example with instructions and additional explanation.

## Requirements

These examples have been tested with a _stable_ `rustc 1.62` (2021 edition).

All examples can be launched via the command line, using `cargo` as follows:

```
cargo run --bin adapter
```
