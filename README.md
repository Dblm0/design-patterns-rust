# Design Patterns in Rust

This repository contains **Rust** ðŸ¦€ examples for **all 23 classic GoF design
patterns**, and even a little more.

All examples are designed to introduce _practical applicability_ in the
**Rust** language. There are _conceptual_ and _real-world_ examples.
In both cases, Rust idiomatic ways of code development and all the specifics
are taken into account.

The repository is developed to be a part of the
[Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) project.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

These examples have been tested with a _stable_ `rustc 1.62` (2021 edition).

All examples can be launched via the command line, using `cargo` as follows:

```bash
cargo run --bin adapter
```

You can find a proper target in `Cargo.toml` of each example:

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "adapter"
path = "main.rs"
```

Each example contains a **README.md** with instructions and additional
explanations.

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

Interestingly, in Rust:

1. Almost all **structural** and **creational** patterns can be implemented
   using generics, hence, _static dispatch_.
2. Most **behavioral** patterns can NOT be implemented using static dispatch,
   instead, they can be implemented only via _dynamic dispatch_.

A well-thought pattern classification fits the Rust language design perfectly
as "behavior" is dynamic in nature and "structure" is static.

Some patterns are really easy to implement in Rust, mostly
_creational_ ones, e.g.
[Prototype](creational/prototype),
[Static Creation Method](creational/static-creation-method/).

The [Mediator](behavioral/mediator) _behavioral_ pattern
is the hardest to implement with Rust, considering Rust's specific ownership
model with strict borrow checker rules.
